## dependencies
This requires [Amulet-NBT](https://github.com/Amulet-Team/Amulet-NBT) from [Amulet-Core](https://github.com/Amulet-Team/Amulet-Core) its probably just best to install the Amulet-Core because it will install most of the dependencies this needs other than python [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)<br><br>
This requires [python numpy](https://numpy.org/)
